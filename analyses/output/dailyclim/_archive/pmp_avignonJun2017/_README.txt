README

This are the files that Iñaki gave Lizzie after working with her on PMP in Avignon in mid June 2017.

We could probably TRASH all this soon if wanted. 

I believe the files he used in PMP were:
fu13_bb_pmp_fit.txt
fu13_bb_pmp.txt
fu13_clim_pmp.txt

You can see his PMP info in test4.txt.

Photos is a folder of the models he fit. Both the type of model and how he went into some PMP preferences file and set one of the triangular parameters to really high (in order to get a more sigmoidal response).
