Davies,2013,Phylogenetic conservatism in plant phenology,J Ecol,Nacho,Nacho,Flowering and leafout times show phylogenetic signal because responses to cues are phylogenetically conserved ,High - sets basis for our study,"They measure phylogenetic signal in timings, not responses"
Munguia-Rosas,2011,Meta-analysis of phenotypic selection on flowering phenology suggests that early flowering plants are favoured,Eco Letts,Nacho,Nacho,"Phylogenetic meta-analyses does not improve ordinary meta-analysis, but using phylogeny modifies the significance of predictors for flowering time",Mid-high - phylogenies may not matter in meta-analytic approaches,The authors do not directly test phylogenetic signal of phenology
Ackerly,2009,Conservatism and diversification of plant functional traits: Evolutionary rates versus phylogenetic signal,PNAS,Nacho,Nacho,Evolutionary rate and phylogenetic signal may be unrelated ,Low - perhaps to interpret final results,Should we plot traitgrams? So far we have not been thinking about diversificatioon at all.
Bolmgren & Cowan,2008,"Time - size tradeoffs: a phylogenetic comparative study of flowering time, plant height and seed mass in a north-temperate flora",Oikos,Nacho,Nacho,"Correlations between flowering phenology and functional traits (seed size, height) differ between perennial herbs and woody plants",Low - but old study accounting for phylogeny-phenology,
Kochmer & Handel,1986,Contraints and competition in the evolution of flowering phenology,EcoMonographs,Nacho,Nacho,Phylogenetic membership and life form strongly influence a species' flowering time,High - sets basis for our study,competition for pollination does not seem to push species' flowering times beyond seasonal boundaries
Willis,2008,Phylogenetic patterns of species loss in Thoreau's woods are driven by climate change,PNAS,Nacho,Nacho,flowering-time response traits are shared among closely related species.,High - supports importance of phylogeny to phenology,They conclude that the effects of climate change on biodiversity would be phylogenetically biased
Zohner,2017,"Spring predictability explains different leaf?out strategies in the woody floras of North America, Europe and East Asia",Eco Letts,Nacho,Nacho,"species from regions with high STV have higher winter chilling requirements, and, leaf out later than related species from regions with lower STV","Low-mid - we do not have data to test procedence, but something to perhaps discuss ",
