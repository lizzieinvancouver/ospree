Davies,2013,Phylogenetic conservatism in plant phenology,J Ecol,Nacho,Nacho,Flowering and leafout times show phylogenetic signal because responses to cues are phylogenetically conserved ,High - sets basis for our study,"They measure phylogenetic signal in timings, not responses"
Munguia-Rosas,2011,Meta-analysis of phenotypic selection on flowering phenology suggests that early flowering plants are favoured,Eco Letts,Nacho,Nacho,"Phylogenetic meta-analyses does not improve ordinary meta-analysis, but using phylogeny modifies the significance of predictors for flowering time",Mid-high - phylogenies may not matter in meta-analytic approaches,The authors do not directly test phylogenetic signal of phenology
Ackerly,2009,Conservatism and diversification of plant functional traits: Evolutionary rates versus phylogenetic signal,PNAS,Nacho,Nacho,Evolutionary rate and phylogenetic signal may be unrelated ,Low - perhaps to interpret final results,Should we plot traitgrams? So far we have not been thinking about diversificatioon at all.

Kochmer & Handel,1986,Contraints and competition in the evolution of flowering phenology,EcoMonographs,Nacho,Nacho,Phylogenetic membership and life form strongly influence a species' flowering time,High - sets basis for our study,competition for pollination does not seem to push species' flowering times beyond seasonal boundaries
Willis,2008,Phylogenetic patterns of species loss in Thoreau's woods are driven by climate change,PNAS,Nacho,Nacho,flowering-time response traits are shared among closely related species.,High - supports importance of phylogeny to phenology,They conclude that the effects of climate change on biodiversity would be phylogenetically biased
Zohner,2017,"Spring predictability explains different leaf?out strategies in the woody floras of North America, Europe and East Asia",Eco Letts,Nacho,Nacho,"species from regions with high STV have higher winter chilling requirements, and, leaf out later than related species from regions with lower STV","Low-mid - we do not have data to test procedence, but something to perhaps discuss ",
Joly,2019,On the importance of accounting for intraspecific genomic relatedness in multi-species studies,MEE,Nacho,Lizzie,Methods paper showing how to include inter and intraspecific variation in ecological models with an example using the Flynn & Wolkovich data,"Low-mid: Limited species (10) but did find 0.7 for signal and does suggest intraspecific variation matters, so worth mentioning I think.",

Pau,2011,"Predictingæphenologyæby integrating ecology, evolution and climate science",GCB,Nacho,Lizzie,"Overview in regards to phylogeny: Lays out how phylogeny might matter in terms of predicting missing species, projecting forward for adaptive potential. Also, nicely outlines this "" Phylogenetic approaches can map both raw observational phenology data, such as flowering dates, as well as model estimates of how strongly species cue to different environmental variables such as temperature (Bolmgren & Cowan, 2008; Willis et al., 2008; Davis et al., 2010)."" Not sure if the rates are great (given the quality of our data, but as J says 'it's easy to do, so, you know, why not?' and the community assembly stuff (which doesn't apply here as we don't have community data) requires 'being sensible to the current literature.'",Mid-high: See section starting on 3636 for a nice overview,

Rafferty,2017,A global test for phylogenetic signal in shifts in flowering time under climate change,J Ecol,Nacho,Lizzie,"Signal in flowering shift (which is just a binned version of slope), but not slope so not sure on signal overall (trust molecular tree results; I recommend ignoring phylomatic results); OU models fit better (which is generally true of most traits) ","Mid-cited a lot so worth mentioning, but does lots of dodgey things so be sure to read carefully (most of the results seem highly dependent on phylogeny so best not to trust much É) maybe we should have multiple trees?",
